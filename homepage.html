            The universe is everything :all of space , time , matter and energy. It encompasses all known physical laws and constants 
            , and the strucutres they create , from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galactic filaments . While our understanding of the universe is constantly evolvong , current scientific models suggest it originated with the BIG BANG and continues to expand .

            The Big Bang is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.[1] Various cosmological models based on the Big Bang concept explain a broad range of phenomena,[2][3][4] including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. The uniformity of the universe, known as the horizon and flatness problems, is explained through cosmic inflation: a phase of accelerated expansion during the earliest stages. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787±0.02 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe. A wide range of empirical evidence strongly favors the Big Bang event, which is now widely accepted.

        The Solar System consists of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The name comes from Sōl, the Latin name for the Sun. It formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, creating the Sun and a protoplanetary disc from which the orbiting bodies assembled. The fusion of hydrogen into helium inside the Sun's core releases energy, which is primarily emitted through its outer photosphere. This creates a decreasing temperature gradient across the system. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is located within the Sun.

    The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System . It is a massive , nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma , heated to incandescence by nuclear fusions reaction in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultra violet energies . It is by far the most important source of enrgy for life of earth . The sun has been an object of veneration in amny cultures . It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity.

    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
